            <h2>Framework Structure</h2>
                <p>In your project's source (`src`) folder, you typically find two folders: one for the main framework and one for tests. The main folder houses your framework components, responsible for all interactions with the web browser, while the test folder is dedicated to writing the actual test scripts. This separation ensures a clear distinction between framework-related code and test logic.</p>
                    <p>The framework structure is a crucial aspect of maintaining an organized and scalable automation project. Adopting a well-defined structure enhances collaboration and facilitates efficient maintenance.</p>
                        
                            <!-- Additional Paragraph Elements -->
                                <p>In test automation projects, there are typically two layers: one is known as the framework layer, and the other is known as the test layer.</p>
                                    <p>If we go to our project view and we look under the source [“src”] folder, we notice that there are 2 folders here, one for the main and one for test.</p>
                                        <p>The main folder is where people typically put their framework.</p>
                                            <p>The test folder is where people typically put their tests.</p>
                                                <p>All of your interactions with the web browser — basically all of the coding that's done under the covers of the application — should be in your framework. And your test files should just focus on the test itself.</p>

For example, consider a login page: the corresponding Page Object would contain methods for entering a username, password, and clicking the login button. This modular approach facilitates easy maintenance and promotes code reuse across test scripts.</p>
